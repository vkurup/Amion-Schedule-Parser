### AmionSchedule

[Amion](http://amion.com) is a physician scheduling service. They
offer a programming interface that allows you to get a group's
schedule in CSV format.

This module parses that CSV format and returns a list of physicians
working on a certain day, with data about how many days in a row
they've worked and how many days in a row they're scheduled to work.
